# Jumprope Eraser

## Installation Files
* [Mac Version](Mac_JumpropeEraser.dmg)
* [Windows Version](Win_JumpropeEraser.zip)

***

## Rationale
This is a Python script I created for the [Jumprope](https://jumpro.pe/) mastery-based assessment software for removing overall marks from Mastery Reports.
Without the numbers, students can stay focussed on self-improvement and have an itemized list of learning targets rather than a calculated average.

## Instructions
Be sure to enter the number of pages for each student before you click the button to select the pdf reports to redact.
You can select more than one pdf file to redact them all at once (just make sure they all have the same number of pages per student).
â€‹The first time you start it, you might have to right-click > open to get past MacOS security. 

You might also find this Chrome extension handy (I didn't make this): [Copytables](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/copytables/ekdpkppgmlalfkphpibadldikjimijon)
It will allow you to cleanly copy the rubric generated by Jumprope and paste it into your documents.
